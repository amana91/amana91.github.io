        <p>The Hotspot Café, is a place for students and young people to come work, socialise or even relax. This allows
            them to work remotely from a place of comfort and peace. The Hotspot Café allows, <br>for everyone to
            essentially come for
            fun and work, there will be a quiet zone for those who want to come for work, a zone for socialising
            or relaxing and another for recreation.</p><br>
        <!--This div class contains different paragraphs of information about the business to let the customer know more about the business-->
        <p>Each zone to fit the needs of young people who want a change from home.
            Creating a space like this will encourage young people to work in an environment
            where they are comfortable and a sort of escape from reality for some as well.
            <br>Having a workspace and café in one will enable all to have an experience like
            no other.</p>
