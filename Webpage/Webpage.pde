      <h3>Amana Zubair</h3>
      <p> I am a student at City, University. I have a bit of coding experience prior to this bootcamp. I have worked at IBM on a workplacement for 5 months.
      I was able to work with the backend developers for the Audi website, in where I was fixing any bugs which may have occured. I was also fortunate to go and meet the clients at Audi in 
      Milton Keynes. We discussed what new ideas we had in mind for the website and if there was anything they would like us to work on specifically.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Flying Ping Pong</h3>
    <p>
  My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
  City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
  of the use of arrays, loops, and if statements. When you start the game you are taken to the main screen from there, you need to
  click on the screen and the game will begin. You can then play the game and also see your score at the top of the screen which I 
  aligned to be in the centre top. Everytime the ball hits the walls you will see the health bar at the top decrease and change colour
  from green to amber to red until the game ends. When the game ends you will be taken to the restart screen where you will be shown 
  your final score and you can click the screen again if you want to restart the game. Each wall is looped and coloured, similarly the 
  ball and racket are set to a specific size and colour.
