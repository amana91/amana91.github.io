          <h2>Amana Zubair</h2>
          <p> I am a Computer Science student at City, University. I enjoy travelling and photography, particularly landscape photography as I get to capture beautiful pictures of earth.
            Some of the programming languages I know include: Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL & HTML.<br>
            <br>I was extremely fortunate to have worked with IBM as a T-Placement student during my time at sixth form. 
            When I first began working at IBM, I worked alongside the Quality Assurance (QA) team. Whilst working with them, I learnt that the QA team is responsible
             for guaranteeing a level of quality for the end client and to support the software development team to identify problems during the early onset of projects. 
             I used a variety of tools some of which include, Yarn, Cucumber, Selenium and Protractor. <br>
            <br> After working with the QA team, I worked with the Scrum Masters and Business Analysts. This part of my placement was a complete eye opener for me because 
            I was able to see the part of the project which ensures that the client's needs are met, and we exceed our performance. I was also lucky enough 
            to go with the team to meet our client in Milton Keynes. 
            There, I learnt what needs to be considered and evaluated when thinking of a new story and planning the next sprint. The product owners look at 
            the work done in the current sprint and identify any changes which can be made as well as evaluate the progress of the team.<br>
            <br>Below are some of the projects I have worked on and completed.<br>

          <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Flying Ping Pong</h3>
          <p>
            My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
            City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding
            of the use of arrays, loops, and if statements. When you start the game you are taken to the main screen
            from there, you need to
            click on the screen and the game will begin. <br>
            
            <br>You can then play the game and also see your score at the top
            of the screen which I
            aligned to be in the centre top. Everytime the ball hits the walls you will see the health bar at the top
            decrease and change colour
            from green to amber to red until the game ends. When the game ends you will be taken to the restart screen
            where you will be shown
            your final score and you can click the screen again if you want to restart the game.

      <!-- Java Module Tom & Jerry Game -->

          <h3>Tom & Jerry Mini Game</h3>
          <p>
            This is my Java module game I created. It's a simple but fun game. There are 5 different levels each with
            different background images and sounds.
            One of the main challenges while coding this game was making multiple levels each with pickup points and
            ensuring that the positions of each body and
            object was correct which ensured the game would be successful. But through this challenge I was able to 
            create a fun game and develop my Java skills further.<br>

            <br>You can see the counter at the top of the game showing how many bottles are collected, you can also see as
            each levels advances it adds more challenges,
            pickups and new characters. There is also a GUI with the options to pause, resume and quit the game at the bottom.<br>

            <br>Below are images of the different levels in my game.
